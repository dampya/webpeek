1. WebPeek can be uploaded onto your browser by going to the extensions option in the browser settings and then manage extensions.

3. Now with the developer mode enabled, you can load the WebPeek chrome extension.

4. For that click on the Load unpacked option on the top left side of the webpage and then select the location where the WebPeek folder is located. Make sure that the folder selected has the main files and the manifest file inside the folder.

Now the extension is successfully uploaded to the browser.

## Getting your Cohere Summarise API Key

The extension requires the Cohere Summary API for it to work to its fullest potential. The Cohere Summary API is completely free to use and register.

You can get your own API key by visiting https://cohere.com/summarize. You will have to create an account if you don't already have one.

Once you have the API key, you can now put it into the WebPeek chrome extension. For that follow the steps below:

1. Go back to the extensions dashboard on your browser, on the WebPeek panel click on details.
2. Scroll down to the extensions option and click on it to open the WebPeek options menu.
3. Once the WebPeek extension option is opened, paste your Cohere Summarise API key in the first box titled 'API Key'.
4. Press the save button to make sure everything is updated.
5. Now WebPeek is ready to summarise your webpages!

**Understanding the Summary Customisation**

**Options**

1. WebPeek provides a lot of customizability to make sure you get the summary that you want.
2. Here is how you can customise the summary layout and what the different options mean:
   - **a. Length-** Indicates the approximate length of the summary. If set to 'Auto', it will determine the ideal length itself.
   - **b. Format-** Allows users to choose the format of the summary, the user can either choose paragraph or bullets.
   - **c. Model-** You can choose from different models to generate your summary, smaller models are faster whereas bigger models perform better.
   - **d. Extractiveness-** This setting determines how close to the original text the summary is. High extractiveness will lean towards reusing sentences whereas low extractiveness will generate different sentences.
   - **e. Temperature-** It ranges from 0 to 5 where lower values tend to generate more predictable values whereas higher values generate more creative answers. The sweet spot is typically between 0 and 1.

**Personalising WebPeek for Yourself**

- WebPeek allows users to get comfortable with our customization options for the UI and languages.
- The user can choose the different pre-built themes for the summary description box.
- We also want to encourage everyone from all different backgrounds to use WebPeek and to make it easier for them we allow users to choose their language of choice. This option allows users to choose a language that they want to read the summary in.

Now WebPeek is ready to summarise the webpages for you the way you like. We recommend using our default settings for the best summarisation but feel free to change the settings and find the fit that best suits your goals.
